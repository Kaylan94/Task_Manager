================ Task Manager With Dropbox Api Integration ===============

README

    This application serves a tool to manage tasks, tasks that are assigned to multiple users.
    The main function of the task manager is to facilitate easy task creation and assignment to user.
    It also offers a stat report feature which can either give an holistic view of the current tasks 
    or a more detailed overview of task-per-user. Integrating the Dropbox Api allows the application to 
    save task logs(user-task-overviews) to a dropbox directory. This feature is built to check whether 
    the desired directory exists and if not, it will be created. Thereafter the file can be uploaded.
    Moreover, the Api allows the appplication to view log history, which is a list of the log files saved
    at the Dropbox directory, and also download a specific file. This download basically writes a new file 
    to the local storage with the content of the remote file.

INSTALLATION

    - The application requires Python in order to run (preferrably Python 3.9.6), and
    - a registered/valid Dropbox account
